    Amplify uses GPT-3 AI technology to amplify your text. Use it to finish incomplete sentences, add to lists, flesh
    out paragraphs, answer questions, and more.</p>
  <p>
    Select a segment of text, click "Amplify your text," and watch it work. The newly added text will be selected in the
    document.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also use select text the "Generate an image" function to drop in a DALL-E AI-generated image based on a
    prompt you enter. Once a image is inserted, the original text stays selected in case you want to do it again.
  </p>
  <p>
    You'll need to add an OpenAI API key to Settings to begin.
