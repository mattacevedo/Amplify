## Privacy Policy

I understand the importance of your privacy and take it seriously. Amplify does not access, collect, store, share, or use any user data or personal information. At no point is any of your data sent to me.

However, note that you will need to supply their own OpenAI API key for the software to function. This means that you will have to abide by OpenAI's terms and conditions, which are separate from these. Please note that I am not affiliated with OpenAI in any way and cannot be held responsible for any issues or disputes that may arise between the user and OpenAI.

## Terms of Use

Amplify is provided without warranty and is used at your own risk. I cannot guarantee that the software will function as expected, nor can I be held liable for any damages that may occur as a result of using the software. You assume full responsibility for any loss, damage, or injury arising from the use of Amplify. I can't imagine how you'd get injured, but ChatGPT included it.

The software is released under the GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2). This means that anyone is free to modify the code and distribute it, subject to the conditions outlined in the license agreement. Any modifications made to the code must abide by the terms of the GPLv2 license.

By using Amplify, you acknowledge and agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these terms, you may not use the software. I reserve the right to modify these terms at any time without prior notice, so please review them periodically for changes.
